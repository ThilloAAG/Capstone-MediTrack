The previous AI engineer successfully built the Meditrack mobile application's frontend UI across several phases, adhering to the user's primary directive to prioritize UI/UX with mock data before backend integration. The development followed a phased approach, initially creating 6 core screens, then expanding to another 6, and finally adding 2 more. Key achievements include establishing Expo Router-based navigation, implementing a splash screen, and reordering the onboarding flow as requested. The engineer consistently used  and  for modifications, followed by  for verification, and expo: stopped
expo: started to apply changes. The current task involves addressing a navigation bug in the global bottom tab bar, where buttons were not consistently working across all pages. The engineer has started diagnosing this by reviewing  and  and has already made several fixes to update navigation links to use  instead of placeholders.

<product_requirements>
The user requested the development of the Meditrack mobile application, based on provided Figma designs (HTML snippets). The core requirements included:
1.  **Initial UI/UX Focus:** Build the first 6 pages, then subsequent pages, prioritizing UI/UX with mock data and mock authentication/device connection.
2.  **Pages to be built (in order of request):**
    *   Onboarding Welcome
    *   Onboarding Features
    *   Onboarding Device Connection
    *   Login / Register
    *   Dashboard
    *   Prescription List
    *   New Prescription Wizard (Step 1)
    *   Prescription Detail
    *   Machine List
    *   Machine Detail
    *   Notifications
    *   History / Logs
    *   Profile / Settings
    *   Admin Panel
3.  **Specific Features:**
    *   Implement a splash screen with a white background and Meditrack text in black.
    *   Reorganize the application flow: Splash Screen → Login/Register → Onboarding → Dashboard.
4.  **Navigation:** Ensure global bottom navigation buttons function correctly and consistently across all pages.
Backend integration and actual device connection were explicitly deferred to a later stage.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Expo Router:** Used for file-based routing and navigation within the mobile application.
- **React Native:** Core framework for building cross-platform mobile UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS (conceptually):** The provided Figma designs used Tailwind-like classes, which the AI engineer translated into React Native  styles.
- **Global State/Navigation:** Managing app-wide navigation flow and bottom tab bar consistency.
- **Mock Data/Authentication:** Initial development focused on UI with placeholder data and non-functional authentication.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses an Expo frontend with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB (though backend is not yet implemented). The frontend's architecture is based on Expo Router for navigation.

**Detailed Directory Structure (within ):**



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : This file was initially the Welcome onboarding screen. It was then repurposed to serve as the **Splash Screen** and handles the initial redirection logic (Splash → Login/Register). The styling was updated to a white background with black Meditrack text.
-   : This file was newly created to house the original Onboarding Welcome content, now appearing after login.
-   : Modified to redirect to  after successful (mock) login/register.
-   : Modified to navigate to the Dashboard upon completion of the mock device connection.
-   : Contains the main dashboard UI and was updated to ensure correct navigation from its bottom tab bar to other main sections.
-   : Displays the list of prescriptions, updated to navigate to  for adding new prescriptions and to  for viewing details. Its bottom tab bar was also updated for correct global navigation.
-   : Displays the list of machines and its bottom navigation was updated to correctly link to the Machines section and potentially to .
-   : Displays user notifications and preferences, with updated bottom navigation.
-   : Displays user profile and application settings, with updated bottom navigation.
-   : Displays the admin panel.

All screens are implemented using React Native components and  for styling, translating the provided HTML/Tailwind designs into native mobile UI.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete fixing the global bottom navigation functionality across all screens, ensuring consistency and correct routing, especially for detail pages like  and .
-   Implement backend functionality for user authentication, prescription management, machine connection, and notification handling.
-   Replace mock data and device connection logic with actual API calls and device interactions.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a bug where the global bottom navigation buttons are not consistently functional across all pages. The immediate focus is on analyzing and correcting navigation inconsistencies, specifically ensuring that all navigation links within the bottom tab bar use  with the correct routes. The engineer has identified problems in  and is currently reviewing  to find and fix similar navigation issues, particularly in detail screens that include the bottom navigation bar. Several files (likely , , , , ) have already undergone initial corrections for their bottom navigation. The goal is to ensure seamless navigation across the entire application.

<optional_next_step>
Continue correcting the bottom navigation in  and other detail screens that utilize the global navigation bar.
